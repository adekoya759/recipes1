We start off with a type of cuisine that is perhaps most familiar to you. 
American cuisine is so diverse that it is worth a full list of its own. Whether it’s Southern food, West Coast delicacies, East Coast favorites, and everywhere in between, there’s definitely something for everyone.
American cuisine is also familiar around the world thanks to the popularity of fast food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC.

American cuisine has many beloved favorites. One such delicacy is apple pie. Notably, the apple pie is part of the famous saying “as American as apple pie”. Ironically, apple pies may not be so American after all. Apples actually originally came from what is today Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, historians believe that Europeans were already making apple pies long before apple pies became an American staple.
